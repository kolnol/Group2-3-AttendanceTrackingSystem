# Attendance control system
Attendance Tracking System project for Advanced Topics of Software Engineering at TUM 2017.
In cooperation with a team of students we develop an attendance control system to reduce bureaucracy at the university. 
We developed a RESTful API server, RPi client and multiplatform Ionic App. 
All the attendance data is stored in a blockchain to increase data consistency and transparency.
